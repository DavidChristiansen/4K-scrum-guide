Working with the Web Chefs: A Guidebook
=======================================

So you're about to start working with the Web Chefs. Let's get cookin'! You already know that we're world-class web developers who are passionate about performance, design, and open source. Aside from the technical expertise we bring, part of our success is attributed to how we approach work. At Four Kitchens, the approach we use is called Scrum.

If you haven't used, or even heard of, Scrum before, don't worry: the Four Kitchens team are scrum experts.  We have three certified scrum masters (Suzy, Andrew, and Leah) and two certified product owners (Todd and Aaron) on staff. We've also put together this little guide to get you started. 

What Scrum is all about
-----------------------

Scrum is an approach to adapting to ever-changing needs in software development. Requirements change, timelines change, ideas change, stakeholders change, and budgets change. Always. With Scrum, the focus is placed on getting the most important stuff done first. The focus is also on getting to demonstrable, releasable features more often. 

In scrum, we get ever closer to a product launch through a series of development sprints. Sprints at Four Kitchens are usually 9 days long. 

First things first: Loading up the backlog

Before we dive into development, we'll take some time to introduce you to the team and the team to the project during the project kick-off meeting. Once the team is familiar with the goals of the project, we'll start to work with you to load up the project backlog. The backlog is a list of features that you want to include in the project. There are two twists to this feature list, however: 1) the features are prioritized and 2) the features are defined in independent, vertical slices of functionality. This way of describing features is called a user story. 


	Definition: User Story
	----------------------
	A user story is the description of a particular action told from the user's point of view. It also provides the reason for the feature. Example: As a site visitor, I want to see the avocado crop report so that I know when to buy the best avocados.

Once we have the product described in user stories, it's time to plan the first development sprint.

Taking the time to plan
-----------------------

At the beginning of each Sprint, we'll ask you to join us for a planning meeting. This meeting usually takes about 2 hours. During the meeting, the team will discuss the highest priority user stories with you. We'll discuss what each story is about, possible technical challenges, and talk at a high-level about possible solutions. Then we determine the size of the story with a game called Planning Poker. This helps the team determine how much work they'll commit to for the sprint.

Planning poker is an estimation card game the team plays to determine the size of stories. 

1. For each story, the team discusses what the feature is about. 

2. Once everyone has a good sense of what the feature is, the team is ready to play their hands. Everyone selects a card with the story point value they want to assign the story. The cards have the values of a pseudo-Fibonacci sequence on them: 0, 1/2, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 20, and 40. Sometimes, we'll also use ? and infinity when someone really doesn't understand.  

3. At the count of three, everyone shows their card at the same time. This ensures that everyone is estimating independently. 

4. If everyone agrees on the size, the value is recorded and we moved on. If the sizes vary, we discuss it a bit more and then either reach a consensus or vote again. 

One more thing: the Scrum Master and the Product Owner don't get to play -- they can help facilitate discussion and answer questions about expectations, respectively, but they don't get to influence the team's decision.

> Protip: Story Points
>
> Story points are a valuation of the relative size of a story when compared to other stories in the same project. The size doesn't always translate into a time estimate. This helps the team determine how much work they can commit to in each sprint.
>
> Why use story points instead of just estimating hours?
>
>In development, like many things, it can be hard to judge how long, specifically, it might take to complete a task. Judging relative effort is a bit easier, though. Mowing the lawn takes about twice as long as cleaning the bathrooms. A german shepherd is about twice as big as a border collie. When working on a project, developers can get a sense of how much work features are going to be relative to other things they've seen before. As the project continues and the team gains experience working together, estimates get more accurate. 

Now that the top priority stories are agreed upon, the team will make a commitment to a certain number of story points. This is the amount of work the team is willing to say will definitely be done by the demo. During the first sprint, the team will commit to a number of story points they feel comfortable committing to. If they end up completing all of the work, they can pull stories in from the backlog. In future sprints, the velocity, or number of story points the team commits to, is dictated by the number of points completed in the last sprint.

With the sprint commitment made, the planning session is complete and the team can get to work.

> Protip: Doing more:
> But, I think they can do more… In Scrum, the product owner must trust the team that they are working at a sustainable pace. The team determines their velocity over the course of several sprints and only commits to that much work for the next sprint. The team, in exchange for the trust, is honest with the product owner about the amount of work they can complete. They don't under- or over-commit. They will commit to what they believe they can definitely get done. If things move faster than expected, the team can chose to pull the next highest priority item from the backlog. With appropriate and reasonable commitments, expectations are appropriately set and all of the work that is expected to get done gets completed.
>
>In a lot of projects, the process is simultaneously feature- and deadline- driven. All the features need to be done by a certain date. This causes a lot of Product Owners and project managers to over-commit their team and teams to feel pressured into over-committing. At the end of the development cycle, however, everyone is disappointed because things didn't get done, there are a lot of bugs, and trust between the team and product owner was broken. 


The Sprint
----------
The sprint is when the work gets done. Sprints at Four Kitchens are on a two week cycle. This means that each sprint is about 9 working days long (dependent on office holidays) with one day reserved for demos, retrospectives, and planning. 

Daily Scrum Meeting

Every day, the project team will convene in the middle of the day for a quick, 15 minute Scrum meeting. This is when the team tells everyone what they completed since the last scrum, what they are planning to complete by the next scrum, and anything that is preventing them from doing their work. As a product owner, we will need you to attend this meeting. The scrum master on your project will provide you with a call-in number. This is a great time for the team to ask you questions, get clarification, and generally remove the obstacles and blockers that are in their way.

> Protip: Daily Scrum
> 
> The daily scrum meeting isn't a status meeting in the traditional sense. It's a standard time that the team can get together and ensure that they are on track for the sprint. The team can also ask the scrum master and product owner to clear the path of any issues that might be preventing them from doing work. The product owner and scrum master must resist talking in the meeting unless answering a question. This time is for the team to ensure they have everything they need.

Pre Demo
--------
If the team wants feedback from the product owner or other project stakeholders before the formal demo, they'll  organize a pre-demo via screen share. Like a demo, the team will demonstrate various features according to the "How to Demo" script written during planning, solicit questions about the implementation, and ask for feedback. 

Sprint Demo
-----------

At the end of the sprint, the team will hold a public demo. A public demo is open to any member of the Four Kitchens staff and any member of the client team. While stakeholders in the client organization are not required to attend, their presence is welcome.

Demos are pretty straightforward:

1.	The team will demo each of the stories according to the "How to Demo" script written during planning. 
2.	The team will answer any questions about the functionality that the product owner or other stakeholders might have.
3.	If the story has been completed successfully (or nearly successfully), the team will ask the product owner if the story is accepted. 
4.	Continue demonstrating.

> Protip: Rolling stories
> When a story isn't quite done.

> During a demo, sometimes it's tempting to ask for small (or big) changes to a feature before accepting it. In this situation, there are a couple of considerations to make. Any change to the feature is more work that needs to be done. Does the feature, as demonstrated, function well enough to meet the requirement or does it miss the mark entirely? If it genuinely fails and needs to be reworked in the next sprint, the story should fail acceptance and be addressed in the next sprint. If it functions well enough, we generally encourage the product owner to accept the story as complete, add the changes as a new story in the backlog, and prioritize the changes against other features. Sometimes that change won't seem so important, after all.

Scrum and how we use it.

At Four Kitchens, we subscribe to the agile philosophy when managing our projects. Specifically, we employ the Scrum framework. If you haven't heard of or used Scrum before, don't worry: the Four Kitchens team are scrum experts, with two certified product owners and three certified scrum masters on staff. We are also accustomed to guiding clients through the philosophy, the process, and the various rituals. This is a quick primer on Scrum and our approach to it. If you want to learn more about Scrum and Agile development, we can give you a great reading list. We are as much fanatics about scrum as we are about development. 

What is scrum?

Scrum is an agile project management process that takes an incremental and iterative approach to software development. The goal is constant improvement: constant improvement to the product and constant improvement to the process itself. An emphasis is placed on getting individual pieces of functionality to a demonstrable, releasable state through a series of development sprints. This allows the development cycle to respond to changing requirements, priorities, and challenges more readily and allows for an evolving product design. While traditional project management approaches a project as a list of requirements as a whole, Scrum approaches each piece of functionality as an individual development challenge. 

On the softer side of Scrum, it's about commitments and trust. The team commits to completing certain functionality and solving certain problems with a quality solution. The product owner commits to properly prioritize stories in the backlog. The team trusts that the product owner has the proper knowledge and authority to define the product and its features. The product owner or client trusts that the team will deliver what it has committed to, that they are working at a good pace, and have the expertise to create the best solution. The team and product owner work together to build the trust. The scrum master works with the product owner to ensure they don't try to overload the team and to ensure there is a ready backlog. He or she also works with the team to ensure that they don't try to take on too much work, have everything they need to succeed, and 

Scrum is characterized by a series of sprints through which the product development emerges. At the beginning of each sprint, the development team makes a commitment to complete a certain number of user stories. 

In the interest of constant improvement, we regularly inspect the project and the process
Sprints a short development cycle (usually 9 working days). I
